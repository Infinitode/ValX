An open-source Python library for data cleaning tasks. Includes profanity detection, and removal. It also now provides detection and removal of personal information. Now includes hate speech and offensive language detection using AI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please downgrade to `numpy` version `1.26.4`. Our ValX **DecisionTreeClassifier** AI model, relies on lower versions of `numpy`, because it was trained on these versions.

## Changes in 0.2.2

We have refactored and changed the `detect_profanity` function:
- Removed unnecessary printing
- Now returns more information about each found profanity, including `Line`, `Column`, `Word`, and `Language`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can view [ValX's package documentation](https://infinitode-docs.gitbook.io/documentation/package-documentation/valx-package-documentation) for more information on changes.

## Changes in 0.2.1

Using the AI models in ValX, you can now automatically remove hate speech, or offensive speech from your text data, without needing to run detection and write your own custom implementation method.

```bash
