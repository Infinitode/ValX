![PyPI Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/valx)

An open-source Python library for data cleaning tasks. It includes functions for profanity detection, and removal, and detection and removal of personal information. Also includes hate speech and offensive language detection and removal, using AI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please downgrade to `numpy` version `1.26.4`. Our ValX **DecisionTreeClassifier** AI model, relies on lower versions of `numpy`, because it was trained on these versions.

## Changes in 0.2.4

Fixed a major incompatibility issue with `scikit-learn` due to version changes in `scikit-learn v1.3.0` which causes compatibility issues with versions later than `1.2.2`. ValX can now be used with `scikit-learn` versions earlier and later than `1.3.0`!

We've also removed `scikit-learn==1.2.2` as a dependency, as most versions of `scikit-learn` will now work.

## Changes in 0.2.3

We have introduced a new optional `info_type` parameter into our `detect_sensitive_information`, and `remove_sensitive_information` functions, to allow you to have fine-grained control over what sensitive information you want to detect or remove.

Also introduced more detection patterns for other types of sensitive information, including:
- `"iban"`: International Bank Account Number.
- `"mrn"`: Medical Record Number (may not work correctly, depending on provider and country).
- `"icd10"`: International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision.
- `"geo_coords"`: Geo-coordinates (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees format).
- `"username"`: Username handles (@username).
- `"file_path"`: File paths (general patterns for both Windows and Unix paths).
- `"bitcoin_wallet"`: Cryptocurrency wallet address.
- `"ethereum_wallet"`: Cryptocurrency wallet addresses.

## Changes in 0.2.2

We have refactored and changed the `detect_profanity` function:
- Removed unnecessary printing
- Now returns more information about each found profanity, including `Line`, `Column`, `Word`, and `Language`.

> [!NOTE]
> You can view [ValX's package documentation](https://infinitode-docs.gitbook.io/documentation/package-documentation/valx-package-documentation) for more information on changes.

## Changes in 0.2.1

Using the AI models in ValX, you can now automatically remove hate speech, or offensive speech from your text data, without needing to run detection and write your own custom implementation method.

## Installation

You can install ValX using pip:

```bash
pip install valx
```

## Usage

### Detect Profanity

```python
from valx import detect_profanity

# Detect profanity
results = detect_profanity(sample_text, language='English')
print("Profanity Evaluation Results", results)
```

### Remove Profanity

```python
from valx import remove_profanity

# Remove profanity
removed = remove_profanity(sample_text, "text_cleaned.txt", language="English")
```

### Detect Sensitive Information

```python
from valx import detect_sensitive_information

# Detect sensitive information
detected_sensitive_info = detect_sensitive_information(sample_text)
```

> [!NOTE]
> We have updated this function, and it now includes an optional argument for `info_type`, which can be used to detect only specific types of sensitive information. It was also added to `remove_sensitive_information`.

### Remove Sensitive Information

```python
from valx import remove_sensitive_information

# Remove sensitive information
cleaned_text = remove_sensitive_information(sample_text2)
```

### Detect Hate Speech And Offensive Language

```python
from valx import detect_hate_speech

# Detect hate speech or offensive language
outcome_of_detection = detect_hate_speech("You are stupid.")
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The model's possible outputs are:
> - `['Hate Speech']`: The text was flagged and contained hate speech.
> - `['Offensive Speech']`: The text was flagged and contained offensive speech.
> - `['No Hate and Offensive Speech']`: The text was not flagged for any hate speech or offensive speech.

> [!NOTE]
> See our [official documentation](https://infinitode-docs.gitbook.io/documentation/package-documentation/valx-package-documentation) for more examples on how to use **ValX**.
